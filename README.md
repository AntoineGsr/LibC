# LibC
This is my own C library. 
You can find some basics functions of the C library and others useful functions.
To use my library you have to:
1st step -> make ; make clean => to create libmy.a ;
2nd step -> in your code, write "my_putsrt" to use the function my_putstr ;
3rd step -> make fclean / make re / make .Phony

If you want to modify the library or to add a new function, don't forget to make it.

PS: make your own basic C library to learn the base of the C language.
Good luck
